/**
 * Created by Nicolas on 11/10/2016
 *
 * This class purpose is to store every information relative to the robots and not used DURING the A* search:
 *      - The robots list (not always of size 2: we can add as many robots as we want).
 *      - Each robot key locations (initial location and goal location).
 *      - Each robot directions stack (used to store the stack of moves that represents the robot's path found by the A* search).
 *      - A boolean for each robot (toBeDisplayed) indicating whether it has gone through its whole path yet or not.
 *      - A direction for each robot (lastDirection), useful to display it in the correct direction when it's moving on screen.
